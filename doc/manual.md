# User Manual

## Name

This is a very private game. It doesn't have a name. You may call it "Game", 
though (like calling a dog "Dog" due to a severe lack of imagination).

## Goal

Move the player (snowman) to safety (into the iglu) while
avoiding deadly obstacles (water).

## Rules

This is a round based game. Each round is composed of 3 phases:

1. Actions phase: At the beginning of your turn. You can perform as many actions as you like.
2. Movement: Moving the player north, south, east or west concludes your turn.
3. Damage phase: this is where the damage is dealt (ice is melted - which should scare the hell out of you)

### Loosing
If you enter a broken tile (water), you die. If damage is directly dealt upon you (sun hits you),
you die (yes, that sucks - so what?).

### Winning
If you reach the finish (enter the iglu), you win.

### End of Game
The game ends when you die or win (no surprise here, huh?).

### Tools
You have some defence weapons:

- **Repair Gun**: point it in any direction and pull the trigger - it will repair
                  all broken tiles in front of its muzzle. Cost: 1 CU
- **Repair Bomb**: It will detonate right where you stand and fix all the tiles that
                   are closest to you. Cost: 1 CU per distance (if the first broken
                   tile is 2 fields away from you, it costs 2 CU).
